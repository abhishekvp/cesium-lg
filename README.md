# GSoC 2016: Enabling Cesium for Liquid Galaxy
###  Abstract

Enabling other applications for Liquid Galaxy would greatly benefit the open source community, thereby nurturing the open source culture and encouraging inter-community bonding. This project aims at enabling Cesium - an open source virtual globe for Liquid Galaxy. The Liquid Galaxy project started off by making use of Google Earth for the panoramic system. The idea of this project is to enable Cesium to run across the multiple displays, providing an immersive and a riveting experience to the users. This project focuses on endowing Cesium with features such as Camera Synchronization, Content Synchronization across the displays and Space Navigation Camera Control.
